# Analysing Fatal shootings By Police in UnitedÂ States

The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. In 2015, The Post documented more than two times more fatal shootings by police than had been recorded by the FBI. Last year, the FBI announced plans to overhaul how it tracks fatal police encounters.

Some Questions to ask while analysing the shootings (CRISP DM)

I am using the dataset to find insights on how shootings are distributed among the various features.

1. Analyse shooting w.r.t age and race of the victim?
2. Was the police shooting based on self defence or intended?
3. Cities with more shooting rate ?
4. How did mental illness and threat level of victim affected the brutal shootings?
